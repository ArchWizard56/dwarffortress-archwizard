# dwarffortress-archwizard

These build files will install Dwarf Fortress with the CLA graphics pack and give female dwarves beards. 

To install, simply:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/ArchWizard56/dwarffortress-archwizard.git
$ cd dwarffortress-archwizard
$ makepkg -si
```

This uses the ABS, so it's only compatible with an Arch Linux system.
